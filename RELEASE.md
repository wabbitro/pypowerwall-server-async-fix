# Release Notes

## Version History

### [0.3.7] - 2026-06-28

**Added:**
- **HA MQTT discovery for solar string sensors** — `ha_discovery.py` now publishes Home Assistant auto-discovery configs for all solar string MPPT metrics added in v0.3.5. Per-string sensors (voltage, current, power for strings A–F) and paired-rollup sensors (AB, CD, EF) are auto-discovered in HA when string data is present on the gateway. Multi-PW3 setups with numbered strings (A1–F2, etc.) are also supported. Previously, the string MQTT topics were publishing correctly but HA never received discovery payloads for them (#57, #59).

**Fixed:**
- **Fan speeds not fetched from TEDAPI** — `pw.vitals()` fan speed fields were silently dropped because the TEDAPI client lacked the `get_fan_speeds()` call path. Fan RPM is now included in vitals data for PW3 systems on TEDAPI (#58).
- **v1r local mode write routing** — control endpoints (`reserve`, `mode`, `grid_charging`) were skipped entirely when no cloud credentials were configured, even in v1r local mode. The `cloud_control_map` check is now split from the `_cloud_control` availability check so that mapped paths fall through to a direct `call_api` POST for local v1r control. Thanks @wabbitro (#60).

### [0.3.6] - 2026-06-27

**Changed:**
- Bumped `pypowerwall` dependency to `0.15.12` — brings in HTTP/2 support for Tesla Owner API calls (v0.15.11, required by Tesla for `auth.tesla.com` and `owner-api.teslamotors.com` endpoints) and remote setup / cloud auth improvements including headless setup 403 fix, `cloudcheck` diagnostics command, and `authtoken` dual-token output (v0.15.12).
- Minimum `pypowerwall` version in `pyproject.toml` raised from `>=0.14.0` to `>=0.15.12`.
- **`mqtt-tools/monitor.py` — refreshed dark palette** with a brighter modern dark theme and adjusted color assignments for better readability.

### [0.3.5] - 2026-06-19

**Added:**
- **MQTT solar string topics + PW3 paired rollups** — per-string solar data is now published to MQTT under `{prefix}/{gw}/strings/{A-F}/` (voltage, current, power, and full JSON). For PW3 dual-inverter setups, paired rollup topics (`AB`, `CD`, `EF`) are also published when both strings in a pair are present. Multi-gateway aware; graceful degradation when string data is unavailable (#48, #49).
- **Combined reserve+mode control endpoints** — `POST /control/reserve` and `POST /control/mode` now accept optional companion parameters (`mode=` and `level=` respectively) to update both reserve and mode in a single `set_operation()` call, avoiding duplicate Tesla audit-log entries. Fully backward compatible — omitting the companion parameter preserves original behavior. Ported from pypowerwall PR #308 (#52).
  - `POST /control/reserve` accepts optional `mode=<self_consumption|backup|autonomous>`
  - `POST /control/mode` accepts optional `level=<int>`
  - Invalid companion values return HTTP 400 without making any Powerwall call

**Fixed:**
- **Serialize concurrent write operations** — concurrent `/control/reserve` + `/control/mode` requests could race on the poll cache. A per-`GatewayManager` write lock now serializes all write calls through `call_api`, preventing corrupted state under concurrent load. Thanks @wabbitro (#55, #56).

### [0.3.4] - 2026-06-07

**Fixed:**
- **Multi-Powerwall visibility in TEDAPI full mode** — in WiFi-only TEDAPI mode (no v1r RSA key), follower Powerwalls were invisible in the `/freq` endpoint because their TEDAPI endpoints are unreachable without a WiFi session. The endpoint now uses `tedapi_config` (from gateway `config.json`, which always lists all registered units) as the authoritative Powerwall list and matches per-Powerwall data by serial number rather than sequential index. Follower units now appear with whatever data is available; fields not reachable without v1r are `null` (#47).
- **MQTT entities stuck "unavailable" on broker reconnect** — the global `{prefix}/availability` topic was never published as `"online"` after (re)connecting to the broker. Home Assistant entities therefore remained unavailable even while data was flowing. Fixed by publishing `"online"` (retained) to the global availability topic immediately after each successful connection (#33).
- **Orphan "Unknown Device" in Home Assistant** — HA discovery payloads included a `via_device: "pypowerwall-server"` field that referenced a device never registered with HA, creating a phantom device entry. Removed the field entirely (#34).
- **`grid_charging` control accepts only explicit booleans** — `POST /control/grid_charging` now returns HTTP 400 if `value` is absent or not a boolean, preventing silent state changes from malformed payloads (#29).

**Changed:**
- **Transient multi-PW TEDAPI snapshot guard** — if a single poll cycle drops follower vitals or `battery_blocks` (e.g., a momentary TEDAPI timeout), the cache layer now preserves the previous complete multi-Powerwall snapshot rather than replacing it with a degraded single-Powerwall view. Applies to all cache consumers (MQTT, WebSocket, `/pod`, `/freq`, etc.).

### [0.3.3] - 2026-05-26

**Added:**
- **`/pw/*` convenience endpoints** — 25 legacy proxy-compatible shorthand endpoints for backward compatibility with the original pypowerwall proxy. All endpoints are read-only, cache-backed (non-blocking), and thread-safe. Includes full test coverage (#13).
- **`din` and `uptime` polling** — `pw.din()` and `pw.uptime()` are now polled in the background poller alongside `pw.version()`, so the `/pw/din` and `/pw/uptime` endpoints return live data.

**Endpoint list:** `/pw/status`, `/pw/soe`, `/pw/battery`, `/pw/grid`, `/pw/home`, `/pw/solar`, `/pw/vitals`, `/pw/pods`, `/pw/strings`, `/pw/power`, `/pw/short`, `/pw/din`, `/pw/uptime`, `/pw/version`, `/pw/temp`, `/pw/alerts`, `/pw/site`, `/pw/status_aggregates`, `/pw/imei`, `/pw/fwupdate`, `/pw/solars`, `/pw/meters`, `/pw/orig`, `/pw/customer`, `/pw/networks`

### [0.3.2] - 2026-05-24

**Fixed:**
- **Battery percentage now Tesla-scaled** in API, MQTT, Home Assistant discovery, aggregate endpoints, and WebSocket outputs. Each surface now exposes both raw SOE and Tesla-app-scaled battery percentage. Previously, MQTT/HA consumers saw the raw SOE value (~4% higher than Tesla app) while the web dashboard happened to rescale client-side (#42). CSV outputs (`/csv`, `/csv/v2`) remain unchanged — they continue to publish raw SOE for backwards compatibility with Telegraf/InfluxDB. Thanks @sphen13 for the thorough diagnostics!
- **`PW_AUTH_PATH` env var** — fixed mismatched env var name (`PW_AUTHPATH` → `PW_AUTH_PATH`) in CLI argument processing so the documented variable name works everywhere (#41).

**Added:**
- Regression tests covering raw vs. scaled SOE across API, aggregate, MQTT publisher, and HA discovery surfaces.

### [0.3.1] - 2026-05-11

**Fixed:**
- **Fixed-tick polling cadence** — the background polling loop now uses fixed-tick scheduling instead of sleep-after-poll, so the effective cache refresh interval matches the configured `PW_CACHE_EXPIRE` value. Previously, poll duration + sleep time meant actual intervals were ~8–9 s instead of the configured 5 s (#38). Thanks @sphen13 for thorough testing across 5 s, 10 s, and 15 s intervals!
- Replaced deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` in the polling loop.
- Corrected docstring: `loop.time()` is a monotonic clock, not wall-clock time.

### [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

**Added:**
- **MQTT Integration** — publish live Powerwall telemetry to any MQTT broker. Set `MQTT_HOST` to enable. All sensor values are published under `{MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX}/{gateway_id}/` with LWT (`offline`) and `availability` topics for clean broker state.
- **Home Assistant auto-discovery** — on connect, discovery payloads are published for all sensors so they appear automatically under a single HA device card, requiring zero manual HA configuration (#21).
- **`mqtt-tools/` folder** — `README.md` broker setup guide with CLI monitoring, HA integration steps, and live GUI instructions; `monitor.py` dark-theme tkinter GUI that subscribes to the broker and displays real-time Powerwall metrics for all gateways.
- **Console MQTT Broker panel** — new card on the management dashboard (`/`) showing broker connectivity, topic prefix, HA discovery, QoS, retain, and TLS status. Fetched from the new `GET /api/mqtt/status` endpoint.
- **`{prefix}/{gw}/name` topic** — friendly gateway name (from `gateways.yaml`) is published so the monitor GUI card title matches the configured name.
- **`MqttPublisher.connected` property** — safe public accessor for broker connection state (replaces internal `_connected` access).
- Exponential backoff reconnect in `MqttPublisher._connection_loop()` (2 s → 4 s → … → 60 s cap).
- TLS/SSL support via `MQTT_TLS`, `MQTT_TLS_CA_CERT`, and `MQTT_TLS_INSECURE` environment variables.
- 37 new tests: `tests/test_mqtt_publisher.py` (18) and `tests/test_mqtt_ha_discovery.py` (19), all with mock broker (no live MQTT dependency).

**Changed:**
- MQTT env variables added to `docker-compose.yml` as commented-out block for easy opt-in.

### [0.2.2] - 2026-03-04

**Added:**
- `PW_RSA_KEY_PATH` environment variable — path to an RSA-4096 private key PEM file for TEDAPI v1r LAN access (new pypowerwall authentication mode). Supported in single-gateway env-var config and `gateways.yaml` multi-gateway config.
- Console **Connect Mode** and **Connected Gateways** panels now display `TEDAPI v1r` when `rsa_key_path` is configured, or `TEDAPI` otherwise (previously always showed `TEDAPI`).
- `Dockerfile.beta` — alternative Dockerfile for beta builds that installs the production `requirements.txt` (for all transitive deps) then shadows the installed `pypowerwall` package with the local source tree via `PYTHONPATH=/app`. Used by `upload.sh` when building a beta release tag.
- Hybrid TEDAPI + cloud control for write operations — when TEDAPI is available, control commands (charge limit, operation mode) fall back to cloud if the TEDAPI write fails, ensuring reliable control across LAN and cloud paths (#19). Thanks @lemassykoi!

**Fixed:**
- Poll operation mode on every background cycle so the cached value stays current; corrected Docker healthcheck to use the correct endpoint (#14, #15). Thanks @jasonacox-sam!
- `pwModel()` incorrectly identified part number 3012170 as Powerwall 3 — corrected to Powerwall 2/2+ (#25). Thanks @jasonacox-sam!
- `rsa_key_path` excluded from API responses to prevent path disclosure; a safe boolean `rsa_key_configured` is exposed instead (#17).
- `upload.sh` trap used `-d` to test for the `pypowerwall_symlink` cleanup target — changed to `-L` so it correctly detects a symlink even if its target is temporarily missing (#17).
- `upload.sh` now checks that the `pypowerwall/` source tree exists before attempting a beta build, exiting with a clear error message if it is absent (#17).

### [0.2.0] - 2026-02-22

**Added:**
- `PROXY_BASE_URL` environment variable — serve pypowerwall-server under a sub-path (e.g. `/pypowerwall`) when hosted behind a reverse proxy alongside other services such as Grafana. All UI pages, asset references, API base URLs, redirects, and console links are rewritten at serve time to include the configured prefix.
- Fetch monkey-patch injected into both the powerflow UI and the management console when `PROXY_BASE_URL` is set, so `app.js` root-relative calls (e.g. `/stats`, `/version`, `/api/...`) are automatically prefixed without modifying the vendored JavaScript bundle.
- README: new **Reverse Proxy / HTTPS Proxy** section with a complete nginx configuration example showing how to co-host pypowerwall and Grafana on one HTTPS virtual host, explaining the `proxy_pass` trailing-slash prefix-stripping pattern and the `PROXY_BASE_URL` URL-generation role.

**Fixed:**
- **Static file 404 with Starlette 0.46+** — setting `root_path=_proxy_base` on the FastAPI app caused Starlette's `Mount.matches()` to update the child `root_path`, which `StaticFiles.get_path()` then used to double-prefix the file path (e.g. looking for `app/static/static/powerflow/app.css`). Removed `root_path` from the FastAPI constructor; path stripping is handled by the existing `strip_proxy_prefix` middleware instead.
- **`app.js` calling `/stats` without proxy prefix** — `app.js` uses root-relative fetch calls that bypass `window.apiBaseUrl`. Fixed by injecting a `window.fetch` monkey-patch into the powerflow `index.html` head (same pattern already used in the console) that prepends `PROXY_BASE_URL` to any root-relative URL.
- **`example.html` jQuery 404** — `<script src="/static/powerflow/jquery.min.js">` was hardcoded without the proxy base; changed to `{PROXY_BASE}/static/powerflow/jquery.min.js`.
- **`example.html` version URL broken on HTTPS** — old code used `window.location.hostname + ":" + window.location.port` which produces `lab.lan:` (empty port) on standard HTTPS; replaced with `window.location.host` (includes port only when non-standard) and added `{PROXY_BASE}` prefix.
- **Console iframe loading Grafana instead of Power Flow** — `<iframe src="/?style=clear">` resolved to Grafana's `location /`; changed to `{PROXY_BASE}/?style=clear`.
- **Console nav and footer links missing proxy base** — header links to `/`, `/docs`, `/api/gateways` and footer link to `/docs` all now use `{PROXY_BASE}/` so they resolve correctly when mounted under a sub-path.
- **CORS duplicate header** — both nginx `add_header` and pypowerwall's CORSMiddleware were setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, causing browsers to reject credentialed iframe requests. Resolved with `proxy_hide_header` in nginx (documented in README).
- **CORS credentialed iframe** — `allow_origins=["*"]` is forbidden with `allow_credentials=True`; switched to `allow_origin_regex=".*"` so Starlette reflects the actual request `Origin` header, satisfying browsers for credentialed cross-origin requests.
- **HTTPS Mixed Content / wrong scheme** — API base URL now honours `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers so the injected `window.apiBaseUrl` uses the correct `https://` scheme and host when running behind an HTTPS reverse proxy.
- **Stray `}` syntax errors** in all six theme files (`black.js`, `dakboard.js`, `grafana.js`, `grafana-dark.js`, `white.js`, `solar.js`) that caused `SyntaxError` in the browser console.
- **`$ is not defined` in theme files** — theme scripts ran before jQuery was globally available. Fixed by explicitly loading `jquery.min.js` after `app.js` in `powerflow/index.html` so `$` is available when themes execute.

### [0.1.13] - 2026-06-26

**Added:**
- Gateway `type` field (`"powerwall"` | `"inverter"`) — inverter-only sites can now be declared explicitly so the console skips battery panels for them (pypowerwall/issues#254)
- Gateway `port` field — non-standard HTTPS ports (e.g. behind a travel router on `:8443`) are now supported; `pypowerwall/__init__.py` updated to strip the port suffix before IP/hostname regex validation (pypowerwall/issues#254)
- New aggregate API endpoints for multi-gateway disambiguation (pypowerwall/issues#254):
  - `GET /api/aggregate/strings` — per-gateway solar string data keyed by gateway ID
  - `GET /api/aggregate/alerts` — per-gateway alert lists keyed by gateway ID
  - `GET /api/aggregate/vitals` — per-gateway vitals dicts keyed by gateway ID
- Console multi-gateway support — Alerts, Solar Strings, and Powerwall Status panels now detect multiple gateways and render per-gateway labeled sections with gateway names as section headers (pypowerwall/issues#254)
- `gateways.yaml` examples for inverter-type and travel-router-port configurations

**Changed:**
- Console initialization wrapped in async IIFE so gateway metadata (`/api/gateways/`) is fetched before all data panels load, enabling correct single-vs-multi branching on page load

### [0.1.12] - 2026-02-21

**Fixed:**
- Fix powerflow animation showing login screen after a few hours or browser restart (#7)
  - Added `POST /api/login/Basic` fake-login endpoint that the Tesla Gateway web app calls when re-authenticating
  - Added middleware to inject `AuthCookie` and `UserRecord` cookies (10-year expiry) on every successful response, matching the original pypowerwall proxy behavior
  - Patched `isAuthenticated` in the bundled `app/static/powerflow/app.js` so the login screen is never shown regardless of cookie or localStorage state
- Fix Powerwall capacity spec comparison using wrong rated capacity (12.5 kWh → 13.5 kWh per Powerwall unit) (#9)
- Added missing `GET /api/system_status` endpoint (parent route for existing `/soe`, `/grid_status`, `/grid_faults` sub-routes)

**Added:**
- Console System Health panel: **Powerwall Mode** item showing current operating mode (Self-Consumption, Backup, Time-Based, Off-Grid), per feature request (#1)
- Console System Health panel: **Firmware** item displaying gateway firmware version, per feature request (#1)
- Renamed "Uptime" label to **"Server Uptime"** for clarity

**Changed:**
- Suppress verbose uvicorn access log spam: `GET /api/...` lines now only appear at WARNING level and above
- Suppress websocket connection noise (`connection open`, `connection closed`, `WebSocket ... [accepted]`) from logs unless running in debug mode

### [0.1.11] - 2026-02-03

**Fixed:**
- Bug Fix: Refactor POD data extraction to handle missing values gracefully and ensure energy values always overwrite system status - resolves Internal Server Error on `/pod` endpoint (#5)
- Fixed issue where `/pod` endpoint would fail with Internal Server Error when extended info was not available
- POD data extraction now properly handles None values and missing battery block data
- Energy values from battery blocks now correctly populate the vitals section

### [0.1.10] - 2026-01-24

**Fixed:**
- Corrected Backup Reserve display on the console by removing duplicate frontend scaling. The server now returns the Tesla-scaled reserve and the console displays it directly.

**Added:**
- Segmented vertical battery graphic for **Total Capacity** (blue) and **Current Charge** (green) on the `/console` dashboard.
- Gray segmented indicator for **Backup Reserve** in the backup panel.
- Time Remaining clock infographic: an SVG pie-sector that scales its total (12 → 24 → 48…) until the remaining hours fit, with a thicker outline and inset fill.

**Changed:**
- Bumped package version to 0.1.10 and synchronized `SERVER_VERSION` in configuration.
- Removed redundant percent label elements from the console UI and removed the center clock dot for a cleaner look.


### [0.1.9] - 2026-01-23

**Fixed:**
- **Critical:** Grid down error in TEDAPI mode when grid breakers are turned off
  - Fixed `compute_LL_voltage()` function in pypowerwall TEDAPI module
  - Error: "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'NoneType'"
  - When no active voltages (all below 100V threshold), function now safely handles None values: `(v1n or 0) + (v2n or 0) + (v3n or 0)`
  - Powerwall API returns None for voltage readings when grid breakers are off
  - Fix allows `/api/meters/aggregates` and other endpoints to work correctly during grid outages
- Pydantic serialization warning for gateway status field
  - Changed `status` field type from `Optional[str]` to `Optional[Union[str, Dict[str, Any]]]` in GatewayData model
  - Allows storing full status dict from `pw.status()` API call without type validation warnings

**Changed:**
- Updated pypowerwall dependency from 0.14.8 to 0.14.9 (includes grid down fix)
- None values from Powerwall API now preserved to indicate missing/unavailable data

---
### [0.1.8] - 2026-01-22

**Fixed:**
- Battery percentage scaling now consistently uses Tesla App formula across all endpoints:
  - `/api/system_status/soe` now applies Tesla scaling: `(raw / 0.95) - (5 / 0.95)` instead of old proxy's `raw * 0.95`
  - Console dashboard battery charge and backup reserve displays use Tesla scaling
  - Scaling properly reserves bottom 5%: raw 5% → 0% displayed, raw 100% → 100% displayed
  - All battery percentage displays now match Tesla App behavior
- Grid status display on console dashboard:
  - Shows "Grid Down" with orange X (✕) when grid is down
  - Grid status checked from cached `grid_status` field before power-based fallback
  - Real-time grid status updates via background polling
- Legacy API endpoint compatibility improvements:
  - `/api/status` returns all required fields (din, git_hash, commission_count, device_type, teg_type, sync_type, cellular_disabled, can_reboot)
  - `/api/site_info` includes complete grid_code structure and energy/power capacity fields
  - `/api/site_info/site_name` returns null instead of fake default
  - `/api/operation` added with direct API call to return raw (unscaled) backup_reserve_percent
  - `/pod` endpoint properly matches TEPOD vitals to battery blocks by serial number
  - `/api/system_status/grid_status` serves from cached grid_status_detail with full API response

**Changed:**
- Background polling now calls `pw.get_reserve(scale=False)` to store raw reserve percentage
- Reserve percentage from API remains unscaled (0-100), only display values are scaled
- Grid status polling enhanced to capture both simplified status and detailed API response

---
### [0.1.7] - 2026-01-18

**Added:**
- Powerwall 3 (PW3) detection support:
  - Cached `pw3` status from pypowerwall TEDAPI connection during polling cycle
  - `/stats` endpoint now correctly reports `pw3: true` for Powerwall 3 systems
  - Console dashboard mode display now indicates PW3 hardware (e.g., "Local (TEDAPI PW3)")
- TEDAPI mode caching for improved performance:
  - `tedapi_mode` cached during polling cycle alongside other gateway metrics
  - Eliminates redundant connection object access in API endpoints

**Fixed:**
- PW3 detection now correctly accesses `pw.tedapi.pw3` attribute (was incorrectly checking `pw.pw3`)
- Console dashboard mode display restructured to show clear connection types:
  - Local, Local (TEDAPI), Local (TEDAPI PW3)
  - Cloud, Cloud (PW3), Cloud (FleetAPI), Cloud (FleetAPI PW3)

**Changed:**
- `sync.sh` deployment script now uses `--copy-links` flag to copy symlink contents instead of just the link
- Updated pypowerwall dependency to newer version with PW3 power reporting bug fix

---
### [0.1.6] - 2026-01-17

**Added:**

  - Power direction indicators (↑ charging, ↓ discharging) on Powerwall power values
  - Total energy storage metrics: capacity, current charge, time remaining, backup reserve
  - Tesla App percentage display alongside actual charge percentage
  - Capacity comparison to spec (12.5 kWh per Powerwall) with color-coded indicators *(corrected to 13.5 kWh in v0.1.12, see #9)*
  - System Health panel with site name, mode, gateways, connection status, uptime, and resource metrics
- Alert sorting by priority (notice → info → warning) in console dashboard

**Fixed:**
- Site name endpoints now return actual Powerwall site name instead of gateway configuration name
  - `/api/site_info/site_name` now includes both site_name and timezone
  - `/api/site_info` returns actual site name from Powerwall
  - `/stats` includes actual site name in response
  - Site name fetched during polling cycle for thread-safe cached access
- Power values in Powerwall Status panel correctly converted to kW units

---
### [0.1.5] - 2026-01-17
